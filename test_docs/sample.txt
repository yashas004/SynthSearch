Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing various industries including healthcare, finance, and education. Machine learning algorithms can process vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks to model complex patterns. Natural language processing allows computers to understand and generate human language. Applications include chatbots, translation services, and text analysis.

Large language models like GPT have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent text, answering questions, and even creative writing. However, these models require significant computational resources and large amounts of training data.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines the strengths of retrieval systems and generative models. By fetching relevant information from a knowledge base before generating responses, RAG models can provide more accurate and up-to-date answers.

The field of AI is rapidly evolving, with ongoing research focusing on making models more efficient, ethical, and aligned with human values.
